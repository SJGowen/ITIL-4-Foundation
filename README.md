### ITIL Service Value System
Governance is the means by which the organisation is directed and controlled.
A practice is a set of organisational resources designed for performing work or accomplishing an objective.

Continual improvement is a recurring organisational activity performed at all levels to ensure that an organisation's performance continually meets stakeholders' expectations.
A guiding principle is a recommendation that can guide an organisation in all circumstances.
The ITIL SVS describes how all components and activities of the organisation work together as a system to enable value creation.

### Service Value Chain
Obtain/Build = Ensures that service components are available when and where they are needed, and meet agreed specifications.
Improve = Ensures continual improvement of products, services and practices across all value chain activities and all four dimensions of service management.
Deliver and support = Ensures that services are delivered and supported according to agreed specifications and stakeholders' expectations.
Engage = To provide a good understanding of stakeholder needs, transparency, and continual engagement and good relationships with all stakeholders.
Design and transition = Ensures that products and services continually meet stakeholder expectations for quality, costs and time-to-market.
Plan = Ensures a shared understanding of the vision, current status and improvement direction for all four dimensions and all products and services across the organisation.

### ITIL Practices in detail
Problem management = To reduce the likelihood and impact of incidents by identifying actual and potential causes of incidents, and managing workarounds and known errors.
Incident management = To minimise the negative impact of incidents by restoring normal service operation as quickly as possible.
Continual improvement = To align the organisation's practices and services with changing business needs through the ongoing improvement of products, services, and practices, or any element involved in the management of products and services.
Service desk = To capture demand for incident resolution and service requests.
Service level management = To set clear business-based targets for service levels, and to ensure that delivery of services can be properly assessed, monitored and managed against these targets.
Service desk = This practice would act as the entry point and single point of contact for the service provider with all of its users.
Continual improvement = This practice would foster an improvement culture across the organisation, in alignment with the organisation's overall strategy.
Service level management = This practice would collect, analyse, store and report on the relevant service performance metrics for all identified services.
Change enablement = Maximise the number of successful IT changes by ensuring that risks have been properly assessed, authorising changes to proceed, and managing a change schedule.
Service request management = To support the agreed quality of service by handling all pre-defined, user-initiated service requests in an effective and user-friendly manner.

### Guiding principles
'Take time to map out the standard and repeating processes as far as possible, and streamline them where you can.' = Optimise and automate
'If a process, service, action, or metric fails to provide value or produce a useful outcome, then eliminate it.' = Keep it simple and practical
'Look at what exists already as objectively as possible, using the customer or desired outcome as the starting point.' = Start where you are
'The first step is to discover who the service consumer is, and then understand how the service is of value to them.' = Focus on value
'The organisation needs to work in an integrated way to handle its activities as a whole, rather than as separate parts.' = Think and work holistically
'Change is happening all the time, so it is important to seek and use feedback at all times and at all levels.' = Progress iteratively with feedback
'When initiatives include the right people, in the correct roles, efforts benefit from better buy-in.' = Collaborate and promote visibility

### Four Dimensions of SM
Systems of authority and communication = Organisations and people
Workflow management and inventory systems = Information and technology
Focuses on activities the organisation undertakes and how they are organised = Value streams and processes
Service integration and management = Partners and suppliers
Workflows, activities, controls and procedures = Value streams and processes
Cloud computing = Information and technology
Relationships with other organisations that are involved in service = Partners and suppliers
Management and leadership styles = Organisations and people
Challenges represented by security and regulatory compliance = Information and technology
