### Sample Paper 2
#### 1) What is the effect of increased automation on the 'service desk' practice?

- D. Elimination of the need to escalate incidents to support teams
<details>Answer A is correct: by using increased automation the impact on the service desk is positive since it removes the need for the staff to do less low-level work. This allows them to then spend more focus on engaging with the users when personal contact is needed.</details>
<br>

#### 2) Which term describes the functionality offered by a service?
- A. Cost
- B. Utility
- C. Warranty
- D. Risk
<details>Answer B is correct: utility is the functionality offered by a product or service to meet a particular need.</details>

<br>

#### 5) How do all value chain activities transform inputs to outputs?
- A. By determining service demand
- B. By using a combination of practices
- C. By using a single functional team
- D. By implementing process automation
<details>Answer B is correct: to convert inputs into outputs the value chain activities will need to use different combinations of practices.

Answers C and D are wrong since a singular functional team or even automation is not appropriate for all activities across the service value chain.</details>
<br>

#### 6) How does customer engagement contribute to the 'service level management' practice?
1. It captures information that metrics can be based on

D) 1 and 4
<details>Answer D is correct: customer engagement contributes to SLM by listening and capturing information on which to base the metrics relevant to service levels, and also then supporting that through ongoing progress discussions. Statement 2 is wrong since that is the practice of SLM itself rather than the customer engagement contribution.</details>
